# Proj4 -- Craigslist Post App

## Goal:

OK, so for the final project we will go with an individual project that implements the full stack. It should include everything that we cover in class. To ease your burden of choosing I'm choosing for you the topic.
You will be building an application that let's me explore a list of Craigslist postings (I'll give you the file). The app should let me see the listings in an orderly manner, it should let users filter and sort by different criteria and registered users annotate the postings.
You must implement full authentication with passport or similar, and add a creative element of your choice. You must get that creative component approved by me on #project, there cannot be repeated creative components. If you need ideas DM me.
Deadline is the day of the final exam.
